A common theme in my work revolves around managing complexity. Over time I have been working on the development of elastically distributed systems, complex domains and data processing tooling and infrastructure. All of these in the context of their respective sociotechnical systems, as software cannot be seen independent from its human factors.

While I have experience with an aweful lot of technical projects, my stack of choice mostly converged towards the following:

- .NET (C#/F#) for backend
- PostgreSQL for (relational) data storage
- Azure and/or bare metal for infrastructure
- TypeScript for frontend based development _(Experienced with React, Vue, Svelte)_

Over time my interests sparked in methods allowing the delivery of higher-quality software. These are broad topics involving social systems, processes, technical architecture and technology choices, which all play a part in ones ability to deliver high-quality software at a high pace. Part of my work in this area is captured in the [Whaally.Domain](https://github.com/whaally/domain) library which helps manage the complexity in complex domain driven projects.
